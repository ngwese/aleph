======= waves =======

waves is a bank of wavetable oscillators with modulation. each
oscillator is passed through a state variable filter.

==== architecture ====

=== oscillators: ===

each oscillator has FM modulation and waveshape-modulation. modulation
feedback is supported through a 1-sample delay. // note: will add more
arbitrary delay / echo shortly. //

FM modulation is implemented as phase modulation; this has some
advantages such as compensating for the perceived offset in center
pitch.

wavetables are stored sequentially in memory, and the "wave" parameter
interpolates between adjacent tables. currently the contents of the
wavetables are fixed, but in the future we should support loading
arbitrary table data from sdcard.

the current contents are, in this order: sine, triangle, saw, "more
saw."

all are bandlimited to 11 harmonics or less, and higher harmonics are
added consistently as the waveshape parameter is increased


the "bl" parameter controls a very simple and ad-hoc bandlimiting
algorithm. when bl=1, the shape parameter (after modulation) is fully
restricted by the current frequency (also after modulation); so, with
bl=1 the shape will approach a sinewave as the frequency approaches
maximum. this helps reduce aliasing artifacts. with bl=0, no
limitation is performed and heavy aliasing is allowed to occur.

note that FM and shape modulation can still produce aliasing; the
frequency components generated by these processes are much harder to
control. // note: this is especially true with the current
implementation of shape modulation; it effectively rectifies the mod
signal. fixing this shortly. //

=== smoothing: ===

all oscillator parameters are subjected to smoothing by simple lowpass
filters, with the smoothing parameter given in seconds. this means
that new parameter values will be approached with an exponential
curve, and converge within -120dB of the target value in the given
amount of time. (at which point the smoothing algorithm will set the
target to the exact specified value.)

smoothing on audio-modulated parameters always occurs before
modulation is applied.

// note: we will add smoothing to filter parameters shortly.//

=== filters: ===

each state variable filter simultaneously produces lowpass, highpass,
bandpass, and notch outputs, which can be asrbitraily mixed.


=== routing: ===

// note: this will change shortly as we add more panning parameters.//
